I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.

What time do you want the call?


I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.

We can certainly do that. Expect a call from us at 7:00, and then again at 7:15.


Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7:30 am?

I can certainly do that. Is there anything else?


I can't think of anything. If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call again.

Okay. Good night, sir.


I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning.

Of course. When would you like the call?


Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.

No problem. We'll give you both calls.


This bus goes all the way to Santa Anita mall, right?

Yes, it'll take us there.


Are you positive?

I always catch this bus.


How long is this bus ride?

It only takes half an hour.


Where do we get off at?

We can get off the bus right behind Macy's.


There's a stop right next to the mall?

Yeah, it's right in the parking lot.


That's cool.

Yes, I know.


Does this bus really go to the mall?

It goes all the way there.


Are you sure?

I know it does. I catch this bus a lot.


How long does it take for the bus to get there?

The bus ride is only thirty minutes or so.


Where do we get off the bus?

Right behind Macy's is a bus stop.


The stop is really at the mall?

It's in the middle of the parking lot.


That's perfect.

I know it is.


Are you sure that this bus will take us to Santa Anita mall?

Yes, it will.


You know that for a fact?

Yeah, I catch this bus all the time.


Is it a very long bus ride?

It's about thirty minutes long.


Do you know where we get off at?

There's a bus stop right behind Macy's.


Really, there's a bus stop right by the mall?

There's a bus stop in the mall parking lot.


That's convenient.

Absolutely.


Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7:30.

No problem. Anything else, sir?


Not at the moment, thank you.

Let me know if you do need anything.


Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow?

Certainly. What time would you like us to call you?


I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.

Not a problem. We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7:15.


On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of 7:15.

Said, and done. Will there be anything else?


No, that gets it for now, thank you.

Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.


Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.

Not a problem. What time shall we call you?


I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.

It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.


Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?

No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else?


No, that's about it for now.

Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.


I need a wake-up call tomorrow.

What time would you like your wake-up call?


I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.

That is no problem at all, of course. You'll get a call at 7:00, and another at 7:15.


Then again, I think 7:15 is too early. Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.

So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30. Do you have any other requests?


Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.

Okay, sir. Sleep well.


I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call.

Of course. We can give you a call anytime you like.


Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.

Your wish is our command. Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15.


Wait a minute! I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it. Change it to 7:30.

The second call is now changed to 7:30. Is there anything else we can help you with?


Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, though, I'll call you.

We're here all night long if you need anything.


I have a reservation. My name is John Sandals.

May I see your ID, please, Mr. Sandals?


Certainly. Here it is.

Thank you. Do you have a credit card, Mr. Sandals?


Yes, I do. Do you accept American Express?

Sorry, sir, just VISA or MasterCard.


Here's my VISA card.

Okay. You're in room 507. It's a single queen-size bed, spacious, and nonsmoking. Is that suitable?


Yes, it sounds like everything I expected.

Could I see your ID, please, sir?

Regrettably, Mr. Sandals, we accept only MasterCard or VISA.


I thought American Express was accepted everywhere. Never mind. Here's my VISA.

Thanks. You're in room 507, a big, nonsmoking room, with a queen bed. Is that okay, sir?


Yes, that's just fine.

Unfortunately, at the present time we take only MasterCard or VISA.


No American Express? Okay, here's my VISA.

Yes, I do. Do you accept American Express?

I'm sorry, Mr. Sandals, but we accept only MasterCard or VISA.


That's okay, I've got plenty of cards. Here's my VISA.

Okay. You're in room 507. It's a single queen-size bed, spacious, and nonsmoking. Is that suitable?


Yes, that's just what I wanted.

Here's your key, sir. If you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.
